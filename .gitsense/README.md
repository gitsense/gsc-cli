 # The Intelligence Layer (`.gitsense`)

Welcome to where your repository's intelligence lives.

This directory transforms your codebase from a passive container into a **self-aware, queryable knowledge base**. Instead of writing documentation that AI agents must read (expensive tokens) and interpret (risk of hallucination), you encode your repository's intent as structured data they can query instantly.

`gsc` (GitSense CLI) uses this directory to import intelligence manifests and help AI agents discover exactly what they need in milliseconds, not megabytes.

**What's inside:**
- `manifests/`: Source JSON intelligence files
- `analyzers/`: Instructions for generating metadata  
- `references/`: Standards and rules for consistency
- `manifest.json`: Registry tracking your imported databases

A traditional repository stores code. A smart repository knows itself. This is the future of AI-assisted development.
